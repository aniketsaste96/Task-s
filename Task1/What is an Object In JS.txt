>Object in javascript is defined as an ordered collection of related data,of primitve or referance types in the 
	form of "Key:Value" pairs. These keys can be variables or function and are called properties and methods,respectively in the conext of an object.
>Most important datatype and form the building blocks of modern javascript.
>Quit different from primitive data types because each these datatypes store single value each.
>Objects are more complex and each object may contain any of primitive or all of them.
>An objet is referance data type.
>Eg.If object is Student it will have properties like nmae,age,addres,id etc.
>In real life, a car is an object.
A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:
  Eg>  const car = {type:"BMW", model:"500", color:"white"};
                 = key:pairs

Object and properties :-
	>A js has properties associted with it.
	>You can access properties with simple dot(.) notation.
	>Eg ObjecName.propertieyName
creating object in JavaScript:
	1.With Object literal:-	
		It is done by simply defining the property and value inside curly braces like
		let Bike = {Name:"R15",Maker:"Yamaha",Engine:"150cc".
		
	2.With Constructor:-
		Consturctor is nopthing but a function and with help of new Keyword,which allows
		go create multiple objects of same flavour as shown.
		
		function Ride(name,maker){
			this.name = name;
			this.maker = maker;
			}
		let bike1 = new Ride ("Bullet","Royal Enfiled");	
		let bike2 = new Ride("Pulser","Bajaj");
		console.log(bike1.name); // Bullet
		console.log(bike2.name); // Pulser
	
	3.Using Js New Keyword:-
		Eg.
		var person = new Object();
		person.firstName ="John";
		person.lastName ="Doe";
		person.age =30;
		person.height =5.8;

	4.Using the obJect.create Method:-
		This is very useful,because it allows you to choose the prototype object for
		the object you want to create,without having to define a constructor function.
		
		//Animal properties and method encapsulation
		var Animal = {
			type:"Invertebrates",
			disType:function(){
			console.log(this.type);}
		};
		
		//Create new animal type called animal1
		var animal = object.create(Animal);
		animal1.disType();  //o/p = Invertebrates.
		
		//Create new animal type called fishes

		var dog = object.create(Animal);
		dog.object ="dogs";
		dog.displayType();
		
		//Output dogs
